  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

  ## Running the Backend Server

  To enable file saving to the remote server (192.168.100.100), you need to run the backend server.

  1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
     ```bash
     cd server
     ```
  2. Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
  3. Start the server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

  The server will run on port 3001 and handle file uploads via SFTP.
